### Fisher's Iris Data Set

##### __**About the Data Set**__

​		The Iris flower data set* or *Fisher’s Iris data set* was presented in1936 as an example for linear discriminant analysis in the work of British statistician and geneticist Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, titled __*“The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems”*__. However, sometimes it is called *Anderson's Iris data set*  as the data itself originated in research by Edgar Anderson, who studied morphologic variations in Iris flowers of three related species: 

·   Iris setosa

·   Iris versicolor 

·   Iris virginica. 

 The data set presents 150 samples of flowers (50 for each plant), featuring four attributes (data **features**):

·   Sepal length

·   Sepal width

·   Petal length

·   Petal width,

all four measured in centimetres. Additionally, the species was recorded for each plant. The combination of these four features served as a base for Fisher’s linear discriminant model for distinguishing the species from each other. 

 

##### **Use of the Set**

​		The Iris flower data set is famous among pattern recognition scientists and statisticians, and has been referenced to illustrate a variety of techniques, for instance, in machine learning, multivariate statistics, data mining, pattern recognition etc. Moreover, it is frequently offered as a standard example data set in various software and other sources, and so has an important contribution not only to science, but also to teaching machine learning.

### **Set up**

The raw data was taken from  [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). 

Programs used for completion of this project are: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [cmder](http://cmder.net/)

Libraries used for the project are: [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). All of these are installed with the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/). 

 

###  How to run the code

1. Make sure that you have Python installed
2. Open Command Interpreter 
3. Get into correct directory
4. Run python code by typing *python analysis.py*
